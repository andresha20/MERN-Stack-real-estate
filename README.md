# MERN-Stack-real-estate
This basic real estate website has been built using the MERN stack. It includes user authentication with JWT and Google Auth, context API, custom drag and drop, among other functionalities. The core functionalities work correctly, it's only missing additional form data, the about page and the homepage (mainly CSS and HTML).

Base64 URL's are not stored in MongoDb because they'd take up a lot of storage. In reality, each image is stored in Cloudinary and from there, the links of Cloudinary are served on the front-end to showcase each image.
